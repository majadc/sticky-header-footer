            I took this vo-tech class in high school, woodworking. I took a lot
            of vo-tech classes, because it was just big jerk-off, but this one
            time I had this teacher by the name of... Mr... Mr. Pike. I guess he
            was like a Marine or something before he got old. He was hard
            hearing. My project for his class was to make this wooden box. You
            know, like a small, just like a... like a box, you know, to put
            stuff in. So I wanted to get the thing done as fast as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester and he
            couldn't flunk me as long as I, you know, made the thing. So I
            finished it in a couple days. And it looked pretty lame, but it
            worked. You know, for putting in or whatnot. So when I showed it to
            Mr. Pike for my grade, he looked at it and said: 'Is that the best
            you can do?'

            Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna
            get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna just bring it to us? God
            it takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way up to
            Las Cruces, two hundred miles each way to meet up with my Smurfs.
            The dudes who go to the drug stores and get a couple boxes at a time
            and then sell 'em to me. And that's maybe only good for, like a half
            pound worth. See that's the bottle neck in your brilliant business
            plan. Of course you would've known that if you would've just asked
            me.
